This is a simple blog app, it can create, update, delete, and view an article.
I use some dependencies like markdown, ejs...

In order for this to work you should have node js and mongodb installed.
You have to run npm install and in the .env file, declare a variable called DB_CONNECTION_URL which will store you mongodb connection string. 
The entre point of the app is app.js
